## Installation

To install brhttp, download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/SUKUNA456/brhttp/releases). Follow these steps:

1. Download the appropriate binary for your operating system.
2. Make the binary executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x brhttp
   ```
3. Move it to a directory in your PATH:
   ```bash
   sudo mv brhttp /usr/local/bin/
   ```

Now you can run brhttp from anywhere.

## Usage

To start the server, run:

```bash
brhttp [options] [path]
```

Replace `[path]` with the directory you want to serve. The default path is the current directory.

### Example

```bash
brhttp ./public
```

This command serves the files in the `public` directory.

## Configuration

brhttp uses a simple configuration file. Create a file named `brhttp.conf` in your project directory. Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
  root: ./public
  enable_live_reload: true
```

## API Reference

brhttp provides a RESTful API for managing the server. Here are some key endpoints:

- **GET /status**: Check the server status.
- **POST /reload**: Trigger a reload of the static files.
- **GET /config**: Retrieve the current configuration.

## Webhooks

You can set up webhooks to automate your build process. When a change is detected, brhttp can automatically trigger a build. To set up a webhook, add the following to your configuration:

```yaml
webhooks:
  on_change: http://your-webhook-url
```

## Reverse Proxy

brhttp can act as a reverse proxy. To enable this feature, update your configuration file:

```yaml
reverse_proxy:
  enable: true
  upstream: http://your-upstream-service
```

## Live Reload

Live Reload is easy to set up. Just enable it in your configuration:

```yaml
enable_live_reload: true
```

When you save changes to your files, brhttp will notify the browser to refresh.

## Performance

brhttp is optimized for performance. It uses Goâ€™s concurrency model to handle multiple requests efficiently. Static files are served quickly, and caching is built-in to reduce load times.

## Security

Security is a priority for brhttp. The server implements best practices, including:

- Input validation to prevent attacks.
- Secure headers to protect against common vulnerabilities.
- Logging for monitoring and debugging.
